## Introduction

I have been wanting to learn how to program a CNC to cut out a design into wood, and decided to do so by making this logo out of mahogany.

## Programming the CNC

To program the toolpaths, I used a program called **fusion 360** which allowed me to load up my model and select different machining options such as a bulk material removal.

For each operation I would select a tool, tool speed, material removal rate, and many more options. 

In the end I simulated the machining on my computer to ensure there were no issues.

I then ran the program on a real block of wood and ended up with a nice finished product that needed minimal sanding.



## Conclusion

I learned alot from this project and plan to use the CNC more in the future for projects such as making engravings, and making a high-quality guitar.
