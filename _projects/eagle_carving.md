## The Process

After seeing alot of cool carvings online, I decided to take a try at making an eagle.

I cut a square block of pine wood, and got a dremel tool with a sanding attachment.

On the block of wood I sketched out the rough pattern of the eagle, and then used the dremel tool to carve out the eagle shape.

I applied two shades of blue paint to the background to make the eagle pop out.
