## Designing the Guitar

I decided to go with a completely custom guitar build, designing and creating everything myself.
Using Fusion360, I was able to create a guitar model that I wanted, with all the features I like.


After modelling the body, neck and fretboard, I was able to create CNC programs for each part.

## Wood Selection

Before creating the guitar itself, I had to create my stock. I decided to use a Figured Maple top and Walnut for the back and neck of guitar.
I used an ebony wood for the fretboard with maple dot inserts.

## Machining
Using CAM in Fusion360 I was able to machine the guitar body, neck, and fretboard individually. 
I then sanded each piece smooth to get rid of all machining lines, and drilled electronics holes.

## Finishing the Parts

Once the body and neck were shaped, I began assembling parts and making sure everything fit.


Some hardware on the guitar was custom built using a MAXIEM waterjet to cut stainless steel.




I then applied a clear coat of lacquer to both the neck and the guitar body to create a gloss finish.
