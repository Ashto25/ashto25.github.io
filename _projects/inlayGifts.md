# Description
Created using curly maple wood resawed into thin panels.
I then used a laser cutter to cut out areas for inlay woods.
To cut the inlay woods I used a laser cutter as well.
The wood in the inlays is walnut (geese, bike, flower stem) and ironwood (flower petal).
The finish is a thick coat of tung oil.
