## Introduction

I wanted to learn how to do basic machining and decided to learn how to use the manual lathe.
For my project to learn, I am making a gearshift adapter for my dad's manual jeep.

## Making the adapter

Due to the gearshift lever not being threaded, I had to make my own adapter which would clamp onto the rod.

I machined a threaded adapter which accepts the gearshift knob and tapped some holes to insert set screws which allows the adapter to securely clamp onto the gearshift lever.
