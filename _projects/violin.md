## Introduction

![Violin](/assets/images/violin_front.JPG)

I wanted to learn how to use the CNC more effectively and get better at creating toolpaths to run. I decided to make this violin using a model I was able to find online.
There are many complex operations and stockholding setups to be done with this project, which makes it a perfect way to learn the CNC better.
