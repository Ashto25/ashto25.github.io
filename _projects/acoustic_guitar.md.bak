## Introduction

Building an acoustic guitar has been a dream of mine for years. I finally took the plunge and started this ambitious woodworking project. Here's a detailed account of the process, from selecting the materials to the final tuning.

## Step 1: Selecting the Wood

The first step was selecting the right wood. I chose **mahogany** for the top, back, and sides due to its warm, rich sound along with its colorful look. The neck is made from **mahogany** as well, and I used **brazillian cherry** for the fretboard and bridge.

## Step 2: Shaping the Body

Bending the sides of the guitar was the most difficult part of the build. I had to soak the wood in water, wrap it in foil, and use a clothing iron to steam the wood until it became plyable enough to bend. I would slowly bend the wood into shape using a form I made. This process took a week to get the sides to perfectly hold their shape.

## Step 3: Assembling the Parts

Once the body and neck were shaped, I assembled the guitar. This involved gluing the top and back to the sides, attaching the neck, and installing the fretboard and bridge.

## Step 4: Finishing Touches

After the assembly, I sanded the entire guitar and applied a finish to protect the wood and bring out its natural colors. I then added the hardware, including the tuning machines and strings.

## Conclusion

This project was one of the most difficult I have completed yet. I learned so many skills from this project and now have a beautiful guitar that looks amazing and plays really well.
