## Introduction

After wanting to learn to play electric guitar, I saw a youtube video on someone making one in a woodshop. This led to me coming up with a design and a plan to create one myself. I watched many hours of videos learning woodworking techniques and specific guitar-making skills. After I felt like I was ready, I started the project.

## Step 1: Selecting the Wood

I used leftover cherry wood sourced from my old kitchen cabinents for the main body. I also had leftover jatoba, also known as brazilian cherry, which I used for the fretboard. For the neck, I bought a board of flamed maple from home depot.


## Step 2: Shaping the Body

## Step 3: Assembling the Parts

Once the body and neck were shaped, I assembled the guitar. This involved gluing the top and back to the sides, attaching the neck, and installing the fretboard and bridge.

## Step 4: Finishing Touches

After the assembly, I sanded the entire guitar and painted the body white and neck with a clear coat. I then added the hardware, including the tuning machines and strings. I also lasercut a sheet of blue plastic to create the pickguard cover.
